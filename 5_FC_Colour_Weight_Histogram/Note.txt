Weight distribution in form of Histogram

The function for plotting weights for the 3 layers in FC models is added. 
Every Pruning round gives the following Histograms:

1. Pruned and Trained models' weight distribution
2. Weight distribution after pruning and re-initialization
3. Pruned weights distribution

#Note: For coloured representation of weights, call the function visualize_model_weights(sparsemodel)
