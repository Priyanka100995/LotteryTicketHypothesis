**Weight Distribution**

The function for plotting weights in the form of a histogram for the 3 layers in FC models is added in Train.py. 

Every Pruning round gives the following Histograms:

  1. Pruned and Trained models' weight distribution
  2. Weight distribution after pruning and re-initialization
  3. Pruned weights distribution

#Note: For coloured representation of weights, call the function visualize_model_weights(sparsemodel)
